            this is a color library that invites users to reflect on the color vocabulary we use —both professionally and personally—
            by establishing intuitive connections between color, meaning, and experience.

        <p>Click "Add Color" to generate a color that will appear in the first row. Then, name it!</p>

<!--to do 
- button- on click sent name is only named after button "add new" is clicked
- canvas and color-library are both displayed and have different functionalities
- turn view/no view for names would be great, so that only a striped background could be seen as well
put inspiration/reference in readme or description
-drag and drop function-->
